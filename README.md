# DriverPass

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a project that when finished will help train student drivers for a driving test at a DMV. Two of the DriverPass clients that were met are Liam(owner) and Ian(IT officer). The DriverPass system will be an online and in person system. The client has website design requirements and other system interaction requirements in place. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well with creating diagrams. I think that I did a good job of creating detailed yet simplified diagrams that represented all of the DriverPass requirements. 

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose on part of my work to revise, it would be the non-functional, functional and technical requirements. I need a better understanding of what each type of requirement is and what they would be for the the DriverPass system. 

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I implemented the user's needs into the system design by collecting user requirements. There were many ways that the requirements were collected and implimented, for example, Scrum Meetings, building user stories, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, case diagrams. 

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Usually before a software is designed a software design approach needs to be determined. In the case of DriverPass, an scrum- agile approach was used. All of the phases that are used in a scrum-agile design approach create a flexible design process. I particularly like the scrum-agile approach and will use the scrum and agile techniques in the future to analyze and design a system. I favor the flexibility and organization of the approach.
