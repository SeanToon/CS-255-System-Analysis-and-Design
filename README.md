DriverPass is a system designed to help train student drivers for the driving test at a DMV. The clients for this project are Liam, the owner, and Ian, the IT officer. The DriverPass system will be both an online and in-person platform, with specific website design requirements and system interaction needs outlined by the client.

I excelled in creating detailed yet simplified diagrams that effectively represented the various requirements of the DriverPass system. These diagrams helped clarify the system’s structure and ensured all requirements were well-documented and easy to understand.

One area I would revise is the section outlining the non-functional, functional, and technical requirements. I feel I need a better understanding of the distinctions between these types of requirements and how to best apply them to the DriverPass system. Improving my knowledge in this area would allow me to more accurately capture the system’s needs and better align with the client’s expectations.

I implemented the user’s needs into the system design by gathering and analyzing requirements from various sources, such as Scrum meetings, user stories, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams. This holistic approach ensured that the system was built around real user needs. Considering these needs is crucial in system design because it helps ensure the final product is user-friendly, functional, and effective in addressing the client’s goals.

Before designing software, it's essential to determine the appropriate design approach. For the DriverPass project, we used a Scrum-Agile approach, which supports a flexible and iterative design process. I particularly appreciated the flexibility and organization offered by the Scrum-Agile methodology, and I plan to apply these techniques in future projects. The adaptability of this approach allows for continuous improvement and refinement of the system throughout its development, ensuring the final product meets user needs and project goals effectively.
